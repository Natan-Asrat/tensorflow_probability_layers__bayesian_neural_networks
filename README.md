# TensorFlow Probabilistic Layers - Bayesian Neural Networks
- In this project, I explored Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) using TensorFlow Probability layers.
- You can get the code in [tensorflow_probabilistic_layers__bnn.ipynb](./tensorflow_probabilistic_layers__bnn.ipynb)

## Building Bayesian Neural Networks
- Implemented a simple BNN using TensorFlow Probability's `DenseVariational` layers.
- Showcased how Bayesian layers can help in uncertainty estimation by learning distributions over weights.


## Uncertainty Estimation
- Visualized model predictions along with uncertainty intervals using BNNs.
- Demonstrated how BNNs provide uncertainty estimation in their predictions, crucial for tasks where risk assessment is important.


## Setup
- Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate virtual environment: `call venv/Scripts/activate.bat` in cmd
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Libraries
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Probability
- Matplotlib
